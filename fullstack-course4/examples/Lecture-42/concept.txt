javascript defines 7 built-in types : 1 object and 6 primitive.

Object
        - It is a collection of name/value pairs
        - Can have nested objects

Primitive
        - It represents a single, immutable value
        - here single value means it is not object
        - immutable means once the value is set, it can't be changed
            -value becomes read-only
            -can another value based on an existing value
        -Boolean:
            -Can only have two value: true or false.
        -Undefined:
            -Signifies that no value has ever been set
        
        /*********** NULL signifies the lack of value in javascript ***********/

        -javascript doesn't have integer type and it only has number.

        -String:
            -It is sequence of characters used to represent text
        -Symbol:
            -Not used much

Undefined is different from not defined in js as "Undefined" means value 
is not defined whereas "not defined" means the variable or function is 
not defined or present in the code.
